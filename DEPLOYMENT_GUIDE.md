# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Base Path
- **Problem**: The `base` path in `vite.config.ts` was set to `/cv/` but your repository name is `personal_cv`
- **Fix**: Updated to `/personal_cv/` to match your repository name

### 2. Import Extensions
- **Problem**: TypeScript files were importing with `.js` extensions
- **Fix**: Removed `.js` extensions from imports in `main.ts`

### 3. Favicon MIME Type
- **Problem**: Favicon was declared as SVG but it's an ICO file
- **Fix**: Updated to correct MIME type `image/x-icon`

## Deployment Steps

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Your site will be available at: `https://DimitrijeIT.github.io/personal_cv/`

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If you prefer manual deployment:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Project Status
✅ Build successful
✅ TypeScript compilation passing
✅ Correct asset paths for GitHub Pages
✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
✅ All components properly imported

## Testing Locally
The development server is currently running at:
http://localhost:5173/personal_cv/

You can test the production build locally with:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Next Steps
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete
4. Visit your live site at the provided URL

The website should now work correctly on GitHub Pages with all assets loading properly!
