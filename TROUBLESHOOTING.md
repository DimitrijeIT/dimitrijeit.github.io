# GitHub Pages Troubleshooting

## Current Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Empty Page on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages supports Vite, but there are some common issues that can cause empty pages:

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. ✅ Vite Configuration Improvements
- Added `target: 'es2015'` for better browser compatibility
- Disabled code splitting to avoid module loading issues
- Configured proper base path for GitHub Pages

### 2. ✅ Added .nojekyll File
- GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default which ignores files starting with `_`
- Added `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
- Added loading message and error detection
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added fallback for browsers without ES module support

### 4. ✅ Improved GitHub Actions Workflow
- Updated to use separate build and deploy jobs
- Added manual trigger option
- Better error handling and permissions

## Testing Steps:

1. **Local Testing**: ✅ Working at http://localhost:4174/personal_cv/
2. **Build Verification**: ✅ Assets correctly generated with proper paths
3. **Module Loading**: ✅ JavaScript properly bundled

## Alternative Solutions if Still Not Working:

### Option 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Ensure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check that Pages is enabled for your repository

### Option 2: Debugging Steps
1. Open browser developer tools on the live site
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab to see if assets are loading correctly
4. Look for 404 errors on CSS/JS files

### Option 3: Manual Verification
You can manually verify the build works by:
1. Downloading the generated `dist` folder
2. Serving it locally with any static server
3. Checking if all paths resolve correctly

### Option 4: Alternative Deployment
If GitHub Actions continues to fail, you can try:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

This uses the `gh-pages` package to deploy directly to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Expected URL
Your site should be available at: https://DimitrijeIT.github.io/personal_cv/

## Browser Compatibility
The site now targets ES2015+ which supports:
- Chrome 61+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 10.1+
- Edge 16+
